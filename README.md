## üîß Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pargat-web/web3-portfolio.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd web3-portfolio
   ```

## üñºÔ∏è Adding Your Own Projects

The portfolio website fetches projects directly from GitHub. If GitHub fetching fails, it falls back to local projects defined in `js/projects.js`. To add your own projects:

1. Create repositories on GitHub with meaningful names and descriptions
2. For the best display, add project images with the same name as your repository (e.g., `project-name.jpg`) in the `assets/images/projects/` folder
3. Customize the `getProjectCategory` and `getProjectTechnologies` functions in `js/projects.js` to match your projects

## üì± Responsive Design

This portfolio is designed to look great on all devices:
- **Desktop**: Full experience with all animations and effects
- **Tablet**: Optimized layout for medium-sized screens
- **Mobile**: Streamlined design with a mobile-friendly navigation

## üé® Customization

You can easily customize the portfolio by modifying:
- **CSS Variables**: Change colors, fonts, and spacing in `css/styles.css`
- **Content**: Update your personal information in `index.html`
- **Projects**: Modify the project data in `js/projects.js` if not using GitHub integration
- **Animations**: Adjust animation parameters in `js/animations.js`
